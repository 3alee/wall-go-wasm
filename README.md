# Wall-Go-WASM

Season 2 of the South Korean reality game show "Devil's Plan" introduced a simple variation on the game Go, aptly named **Wall Go**. For fans out there who desperately wanted to try out the game for themselves, I developed a quick **playable online version** using React, Rust and WASM.

If you'd prefer a **cross-platform app** using Tauri, I've created one which is **downloadable** for MacOS, Linus and Windows. I have personally tested out the MacOS and Windows builds, though the Linux one should work regardless: https://github.com/3alee/Wall-Go/releases

## Gameplay

Currently, wall breaking has not been added as a feature, and player vs computer matches have yet to be introduced.

## Wall Go by other Coders 

I was partially inspired by some other guys who tried their hand at recreating the game as well
