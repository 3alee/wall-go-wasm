# Wall-Go-WASM

Season 2 of the South Korean reality game show "Devil's Plan" introduced a simple variation on the game Go, aptly named **Wall Go**. For fans out there who are interested in trying out the game for themselves, I developed a quick **playable online version** using React, Rust and WASM.

If you'd prefer a **cross-platform app** using Tauri, I've created one which is **downloadable** for MacOS, Linus and Windows. I have personally tested out the MacOS and Windows builds, though the Linux one should work regardless: <https://github.com/3alee/Wall-Go/releases>

For fans out there who are interested in trying out the game for themselves, I have developed both a **playable online version**, and a **downloadable cross-platform app**.

The **desktop app** I've created was made using React, Rust and Tauri, and is downloadable for MacOS, Linus and Windows. I
have personally tested out the MacOS and Windows builds, though the Linux one should work regardless.

The **online version** is a WebAssembly port of the same Rust code, and should work on any modern browser.

## Gameplay

Currently, wall breaking has not been added as a feature, and player vs computer matches have yet to be introduced.

## Wall Go by other Coders

I was partially inspired by some other guys who tried their hand at recreating the game as well
